  Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
  Establishes a comprehensive framework for revenue recognition based on the 
  transfer of control of goods and services to customers.

ifrs_equivalent: IFRS-15

core_principle: >
  Recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services 
  to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the 
  entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.

common_issues:

    guidance: "Evaluate if customer can benefit separately and promises are separately identifiable"
    
  - issue: "Variable consideration estimation and constraint"
    guidance: "Use expected value or most likely amount; constrain if reversal highly probable"
    
  - issue: "Determining standalone selling prices"
    guidance: "Observable price preferred; use estimation methods if not observable"
    
  - issue: "Over time vs point in time recognition"
    guidance: "Apply three over-time criteria; default to point in time if none met"
    
  - issue: "Principal vs agent determination"
    guidance: "Focus on control of goods/services before transfer to customer"
